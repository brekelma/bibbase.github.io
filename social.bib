in social data. According to the paradox, the trends observed in
data that has been aggregated over an entire population may be
quite different from, and even opposite to, those of the underlying
subgroups. Failure to take this effect into account can lead
analysis to wrong conclusions. We present a statistical method to
automatically identify Simpson’s paradox in data by comparing
statistical trends in the aggregate data to those in the disaggregated
subgroups. We apply the approach to data from Stack Exchange, a
popular question-answering platform, to analyze factors affecting
answerer performance, specifically, the likelihood that an answer
provided by a user will be accepted by the asker as the best answer
to his or her question. Our analysis confirms a known Simpson’s
paradox and identifies several new instances. These paradoxes provide
novel insights into user behavior on Stack Exchange.},

abstract="Social networks affect individuals' economic opportunities and well-being. However, few of the factors thought to shape networks---culture, language, education, and income---were empirically validated at scale. To fill this gap, we collected a large number of social media posts from a major US metropolitan area. By associating these posts with US Census tracts through their locations, we linked socioeconomic indicators to group-level signals extracted from social media, including emotions, language, and online social ties. Our analysis shows that tracts with higher education levels have weaker social ties, but this effect is attenuated for tracts with high ratio of Hispanic residents. Negative emotions are associated with more frequent online interactions, or stronger social ties, while positive emotions are associated with weaker ties. These results hold for both Spanish and English tweets, evidencing that language does not affect this relationship between emotion and social ties. Our findings highlight the role of cognitive and demographic factors in online interactions and demonstrate the value of traditional social science sources, like US Census data, within social media studies.",

We find significant heterogeneity in the improvement of player performance, given by score, and address this by dividing players into similar skill levels and segmenting each player's activity into sessions, i.e., sequence of game rounds without an extended break. After disaggregating data, we find that performance improves with practice across all skill levels. More interestingly, players are more likely to end their session after an especially large improvement, leading to a peak score in their very last game of a session. In addition, success is strongly correlated with a lower quitting rate when the score drops, and only weakly correlated with skill, in line with psychological findings about the value of persistence and ``grit'': successful players are those who persist in their practice despite lower scores.
Finally, we train an $\epsilon$-machine, a type of hidden Markov model, and find a plausible mechanism of game play that can predict player performance and quitting the game.
Our work raises the possibility of real-time assessment and behavior prediction that can be used to optimize human performance.},

Analyzing millions of answers posted over the period from 2008 to 2014, we uncover regular short-term and long-term changes in quality. In the short-term,
quality deteriorates over the course of a single session, with each successive answer becoming shorter, with fewer code lines and links, and less likely to be accepted. In contrast, performance improves over the long-term, with more experienced users producing higher quality answers. These trends are not a consequence of data heterogeneity, but rather have a behavioral origin. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between short-term deterioration in performance, potentially due to mental fatigue or attention depletion, and long-term performance improvement due to learning and skill acquisition, and its impact on the quality of user-generated content.},

Question answering sites, such as Stack Exchange, rely on the  ” wisdom of crowds” effect to identify the best answers to questions asked by users. We analyze data from 250 communities on the Stack Exchange network to pinpoint factors affecting which answers are chosen as the best answers. Our results suggest that, rather than evaluate all available answers to a question, users rely on simple cognitive heuristics to choose an answer to vote for or accept. These cognitive heuristics are linked to an answer's salience, such as the order in which it is listed and how much screen space it occupies. While askers appear to depend on heuristics to a greater extent than voters when choosing an answer to accept as the most helpful one, voters use acceptance itself as a heuristic, and they are more likely to choose the answer after it has been accepted than before that answer was accepted. These heuristics become more important in explaining and predicting behavior as the number of available answers to a question increases. Our findings suggest that crowd judgments may become less reliable as the number of answers grows.},

Unpredictability stems from the ``rich get richer'' effect, whereby small fluctuations in the market share or popularity of products are amplified over time by social in uence. In this paper, we report results of an experimental study that shows that unpredictability is not an inherent property of social influence. We investigate strategies for creating markets in which the popularity of products is better aligned with their underlying quality. For our study, we created a cultural market of science stories and conducted randomized experiments on different policies for presenting the stories to study participants. Specically, we varied how the stories were ranked, and whether or not participants were shown the ratings these stories received from others. We present a policy that leverages social influence and product positioning to help distinguish the product's market share (popularity) from underlying quality. Highlighting products with the highest estimated quality reduces the ``rich get richer'' effect of using popularity directly. We show that this policy allows us to more robustly and predictably identify high quality products and promote blockbusters. The policy can be used to create more efficient online cultural markets with a better allocation of resources to products.},

These big spenders are more likely to be male and older, and less likely to be from the US. We study how they adopt and abandon individual app, and find that, after an initial phase of increased daily spending, users gradually lose interest: the delay between their purchases increases and the spending decreases with a sharp drop toward the end. Finally, we model the in-app purchasing behavior in multiple steps: 1) we model the time between purchases; 2) we train a classifier to predict whether the user will make a purchase from a new app or continue purchasing from the existing app; and 3) based on the outcome of the previous step, we attempt to predict the exact app, new or existing, from which the next purchase will come.

Despite its growing popularity, few largescale  studies examined Uber specifically, or the factors affecting user participation in the sharing economy in general. We address this gap through a large-scale study of the Uber market that analyzes 59M rides spanning a period of 7 months. These data were extracted from email receipts sent by Uber. Our data set allows us to examine the role of demographics, including age, gender, and race, on participation in the ride-sharing economy. The data is also fine-grained enough to evaluate the impact of dynamic pricing (i.e., surge pricing) and income on both rider and driver behavior. We find that the surge pricing does not bias Uber use towards higher income riders. Moreover, we show that more homophilous matches, e.g., riders to drivers of a similar age, can result in a higher driver ratings. Finally, we focus on factors that affect retention and use information from early rides to accurately predict which riders or drivers will become active Uber users.},

Longer sessions have different characteristics than shorter ones, and this distinction is already visible in the first minute of a person’s session activity. This allows us to predict the ultimate length of his or her session and how much content the person will see. The length of the session and other factors are in turn predictive of when the individual will return. Within a session, the amount of time a person spends on different kinds of content depends on both the person’s demographic attributes, such as age and the number of Facebook friends, and the length of the time elapsed since the start of the session. We also find that liking and commenting is very non-uniformly distributed between sessions. Predictions of session duration and activity can potentially be leveraged to more efficiently cache content, especially to mobile devices in places with poor communications infrastructure, in order to improve user online experience.},

We demonstrate that later in a session on Twitter, people prefer to perform simpler tasks, such as replying and retweeting others’ posts, rather than composing original messages, and they also tend to post shorter messages. We measure the strength of this effect empirically and statistically using mixed-effects models, and find that the first post of a session is up to 25\% more likely to be a composed message, and 10- 20\% less likely to be a reply or retweet. Qualitatively, our results hold for different populations of Twitter users segmented by how active and well-connected they are.

Due to the constraints of available time and cognitive resources, the ease of discovery strongly impacts how people allocate their attention to social media content. As a consequence, the position of information in an individual's social feed, as well as explicit social signals about its popularity, determine whether it will be seen, and the likelihood that it will be shared with followers. Accounting for these cognitive limits simplifies mechanics of information diffusion in online social networks and explains puzzling empirical observations: (i) information generally fails to spread in social media and (ii) highly connected people are less likely to re-share information. Studies of information diffusion on different social media platforms reviewed here suggest that the interplay between human cognitive limits and network structure differentiates the spread of information from other social contagions, such as the spread of a virus through a population.},

Our findings suggest performance deterioration: Sessions of increasing intensity are associated with the production of shorter, progressively less complex comments, which receive declining quality scores (as rated by other users), and are less and less engaging (i.e., they attract fewer responses).

How people react to social signals, in combination with content quality and its presentation order, determines the outcomes of peer recommendation, i.e., item popularity. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we experimentally measure the effects of social  signals in peer recommendation. Specifically, after controlling for variation due to item content  and its position, we find that social  signals affect item popularity about half as much as position and content do. These effects are somewhat correlated, so social  signals exacerbate the ``rich get richer'' phenomenon, which results in a wider variance of popularity. Further, social signals change individual preferences, creating a ``herding'' effect that biases people's judgments about the content. Despite this, we find that social  signals improve the efficiency of peer recommendation by reducing the effort devoted to evaluating content while maintaining recommendation quality.

more money spent on online purchases. We also look at dynamics

observe daily and weekly cycles in purchasing behavior. More interestingly,
we observe temporal patterns in individual purchasing
behavior suggesting shoppers have finite budgets: the more expensive
an item, the longer the shopper waits since the last purchase
to buy it. We also observe that shoppers who email each other
purchase more similar items than socially unconnected shoppers,

build a model to predict when shoppers will make a purchase and

Previous studies of email were largely based on surveys and limited to relatively small populations of email users within organizations. In this paper, we report results of a large-scale study of more than 2 million users exchanging 16 billion emails over several months. We quantitatively characterize the replying behavior in conversations within pairs of users. In particular, we study the time it takes the user to reply to a received message and the length of the reply sent. We consider a variety of factors that affect the reply time and length, such as the stage of the conversation, user demographics, and use of portable devices. In addition, we study how increasing load affects emailing behavior. We find that as users receive more email messages in a day, they reply to a smaller fraction of them, using shorter replies. However, their responsiveness remains intact, and they may even reply to emails faster. Finally, we predict the time to reply, length of reply, and whether the reply ends a conversation. We demonstrate considerable improvement over the baseline in all three prediction tasks, showing the significant role that the factors that we uncover play, in determining replying behavior. We rank these factors based on their predictive power. Our findings have important implications for understanding human behavior and designing better email management applications for tasks like ranking unread emails.},

 title = {Partitioning Networks with Node Attributes by Compressing Information Flow},
 journal = {ACM Trans. Knowl. Discov. Data},
     abstract = {Real-world networks are often organized as modules or communities of similar
nodes that serve as functional units. These networks are also rich in content,
with nodes having distinguishing features or attributes. In order to discover a
network's modular structure, it is necessary to take into account not only its
links but also node attributes. We describe an information-theoretic method
that identifies modules by compressing descriptions of information flow on a
network. Our formulation introduces node content into the description of
information flow, which we then minimize to discover groups of nodes with
similar attributes that also tend to trap the flow of information. The method
has several advantages: it is conceptually simple and does not require ad-hoc
parameters to specify the number of modules or to control the relative
contribution of links and node attributes to network structure. We apply the
proposed method to partition real-world networks with known community
structure. We demonstrate that adding node attributes helps recover the
underlying community structure in content-rich networks more effectively than
using links alone. In addition, we show that our method is faster and more
accurate than alternative state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  abstract={Recent advances in clustering have included continuous relaxations of the Cheeger cut problem and those
  which address its linear approximation using the graph Laplacian. In this paper, we show how to use the graph
  Laplacian to solve the fully nonlinear Cheeger cut problem, as well as the ratio cut optimization task. Both problems
  are connected to total variation minimization, and the related Ginzburg-Landau functional is used in the derivation
  of the methods. The graph framework discussed in this paper is undirected. The resulting algorithms are efficient
  ways to cluster the data into two classes, and they can be easily extended to the case of multiple classes, or used
  on a multiclass data set via recursive bipartitioning. In addition to showing results on benchmark data sets, we also
  show an application of the algorithm to hyperspectral video data.},

@article{Yan2016peerj,
    abstract = {We study the interplay between a dynamical process and the structure of the network on which it unfolds
    using the parameterized Laplacian framework. This framework allows for defining and characterizing an ensemble of
    dynamical processes on a network beyond what the traditional Laplacian is capable of modeling. This, in turn,
    allows for studying the impact of the interaction between dynamics and network topology on the quality-measure of
    network clusters and centrality, in order to effectively identify important vertices and communities in the
    network. Specifically, for each dynamical process in this framework, we define a centrality measure that captures a
    vertex's participation in the dynamical process on a given network and also define a function that measures the
    quality of every subset of vertices as a potential cluster (or community) with respect to this process. We show
    that the subset-quality function generalizes the traditional conductance measure for graph partitioning. We
    partially justify our choice of the quality function by showing that the classic Cheeger's inequality, which
    relates the conductance of the best cluster in a network with a spectral quantity of its Laplacian matrix, can be
    extended to the parameterized Laplacian. The parameterized Laplacian framework brings under the same umbrella a
    surprising variety of dynamical processes and allows us to systematically compare the different perspectives they
    create on network structure.},

    abstract = {Individual's decisions, from what product to buy to whether to engage in risky behavior, often depend
    on the choices, behaviors, or states of other people. People, however, rarely have global knowledge of the states
    of others, but must estimate them from the local observations of their social contacts. Network structure can
    significantly distort individual?s local observations. Under some conditions, a state that is globally rare in a
    network may be dramatically over-represented in the local neighborhoods of many individuals. This effect, which we
    call the ?majority illusion,? leads individuals to systematically overestimate the prevalence of that state, which
    may accelerate the spread of social contagions. We develop a statistical model that quantifies this effect and
    validate it with measurements in synthetic and real-world networks. We show that the illusion is exacerbated in
    networks with a heterogeneous degree distribution and disassortative structure.</p>},

  abstract = {Individuals' access to information in a social network depends on its distributed and where in the
  network individuals position themselves. However, individuals have limited capacity to manage their social
  connections and process information. In this work, we study how this limited capacity and network structure interact
  to affect the diversity of information social media users receive. Previous studies of the role of networks in
  information access were limited in their ability to measure the diversity of information. We address this problem by
  learning the topics of interest to social media users by observing messages they share online with their followers.
  We present a probabilistic model that incorporates human cognitive constraints in a generative model of information
  sharing. We then use the topics learned by the model to measure the diversity of information users receive from their
  social media contacts. We confirm that users in structurally diverse network positions, which bridge otherwise
  disconnected regions of the follower graph, are exposed to more diverse information. In addition, we identify user
  effort as an important variable that mediates access to diverse information in social media. Users who invest more
  effort into their activity on the site not only place themselves in more structurally diverse positions within the
  network than the less engaged users, but they also receive more diverse information when located in similar network
  positions. These findings indicate that the relationship between network structure and access to information in
  networks is more nuanced than previously thought.},
